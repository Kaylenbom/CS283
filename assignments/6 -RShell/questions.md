1. How does the remote client determine when a command's output is fully received from the server, and what techniques can be used to handle partial reads or ensure complete message transmission?

It checks for an EOF at the end of the commands to know that the output has completed for that command, some techniques for partial reads could reading in loops, the client would keep reading from the socket until it got everything it needed. 

2. This week's lecture on TCP explains that it is a reliable stream protocol rather than a message-oriented one. Since TCP does not preserve message boundaries, how should a networked shell protocol define and detect the beginning and end of a command sent over a TCP connection? What challenges arise if this is not handled correctly?

A networked shell can use delimiters or timeouts to detect the beginning or the end of the command. If boundaries are not handled correctly it could lead to challenges like buffer overflows, partial reads, or corruption of data. 

3. Describe the general differences between stateful and stateless protocols.

The general difference between the two is that stateful protocols handles information between requests which allow them to track the state accross multiple exchanges. Each requests from the client depends on the previous ones. While the stateless protocols dont keep any information between requests and each request is independent of the other and not relying on the previous one. 

4. Our lecture this week stated that UDP is "unreliable". If that is the case, why would we ever use it?

It can still be useful when speed and low latency are more importand than reliablity. It could be used for streaming or real-time gaming where its ok to have some pocket loss and the priority is instead fast transmission. 

5. What interface/abstraction is provided by the operating system to enable applications to use network communications?

Sockets are provided for network communications. It allows the application to send and recieve data over a network using TCP.
